A Progressive Web Application (PWA) made using Angular 7, Angular Material and Bootstrap is a desktop and mobile-friendly application. The traditional idea to make different applications for various devices is challenged by PWAs in Angular, which is a lightweight app making it easier for the user to experience the app in any device of their choice.

The uploaded project is a frontend focused application, it has the following UI and UX Components-
- [ X ] A landing page for the participants and Admin users.
- [ X ] An event registration page for the participants with the necessary form fields. An option to upload their photo ID is incorporated in the application.
- [ X ] Participants can preview their application and edit it.
- [ X ] A chart for the Admin user to view the count of Registration types.
- [ X ] A table to view the list of all registrations with functionality like sorting, pagination and a filter.

The objective of this application is to make a prototype of the idea and give users a peek into the big picture, by giving users the ability to interact with the application. The project is expected to take on following future steps-
- [ X ] Building a solid backend integrated with a database.
- [ X ] Implementing analytics for the Admin user with components like Dashboards.
