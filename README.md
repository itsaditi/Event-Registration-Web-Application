A Progressive Web Application (PWA) made using Angular 7, Angular Material and Bootstrap is a desktop and mobile-friendly application. The traditional idea to make different applications for various devices is challenged by PWAs in Angular, which is a lightweight app making it easier for the user to experience the app in any device of their choice.

The uploaded project is a frontend focused application, it has the following UI and UX Components-
<ul>
  <li>A landing page for the participants and Admin users.</li>
  <li>An event registration page for the participants with the necessary form fields. An option to upload their photo ID is incorporated in the application.</li>
  <li>Participants can preview their application and edit it.</li>
  <li>A chart for the Admin user to view the count of Registration types.</li>
  <li>A table to view the list of all registrations with functionality like sorting, pagination and a filter.
</li>
</ul>
